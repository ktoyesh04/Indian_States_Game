# Indian States Game with CSV File Generation
As part of my programming journey, I developed a game that tests users' knowledge of Indian states and union territories. The game prompts the user to enter the name of a state or union territory, and then checks whether the user's input matches one of the Indian states or union territories.

If the user enters a correct answer, the state or union territory is displayed on the map. If the user enters an incorrect answer, the user is prompted to try again until they enter the correct name of the state or union territory. The game continues until the user has correctly identified all Indian states and union territories.

In addition to the game, I also added a feature that generates a CSV file of the Indian states and union territories that the user has not yet entered. This feature allows users to keep track of their progress in the game and ensure that they have identified all Indian states and union territories.

I implemented the project using Python and the Pandas library. Pandas allowed me to read and manipulate data from a CSV file that contained all Indian states and union territories. I used conditional statements to check whether the user's input matched one of the Indian states or union territories and to generate the CSV file when the user entered "exit".

This project challenged me to think creatively about how to use Python to create an engaging and educational game. The addition of the CSV feature demonstrated my ability to think outside the box and add practical functionality to my projects.

In addition to the Indian states game and CSV file generation, I also implemented a feature that requires the user to specify whether their input is a state, union territory, or national capital territory. This feature ensures that the user is aware of the type of input they are providing and helps them learn about the different types of administrative divisions in India.

For example, if the user enters "Delhi", they must also include "(NCT)" to indicate that it is a national capital territory. Similarly, if the user enters "Telangana", they must include "(S)" to indicate that it is a state.

I implemented this feature using conditional statements in Python. The program checks whether the user's input contains "(S)", "(UT)", or "(NCT)" and then processes the input accordingly. This feature adds an additional layer of educational value to the game, as users can learn about the different types of administrative divisions in India while playing.

Overall, this project allowed me to develop my programming skills in Python and apply them to a fun and engaging game. The addition of the input type feature demonstrates my ability to think creatively and add practical functionality to my projects.
